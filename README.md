# Color-space-stimuli

This is the repository of code that I use to build complex colored stimuli for visual neuroscience research.

Color space transformations are computer-specific, thus, this code will only produce accurate transformations for the computers on which it was calibrated (cemnl/cmap behavioral testing rooms, umass hmrc BOLD screen). 

Important note: anytime a color transformation is performed using the matlab code, you will probably need to add "color_toolbox_v1" to your path, or you will get an error.
